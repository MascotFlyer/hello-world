# hello-world
An attempt to control my "PiCar" using Node.JS to create an http: socket on my phone to read the angles 
and use these to control the servo's using Python.
Trying to use zerorpc to do this but having trouble getting this to work on Ubuntu MATE on the Raspberry Pi.
But got the same code working on lubuntu hosted on a pc. Suspect it is my installation of npm zerorpc which is causing the problem.
